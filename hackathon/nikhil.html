            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small one">  India’s first university exclusively for transgender people to 
                facilitate education for the community from class 1 to postgraduation, is set to open in Uttar Pradesh’s
                 Kushinagar district.</p> 
                 <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">  The university, which will be opened in Fazilnagar block of the district,
                  is being built by the Akhil Bhartiya Kinnar Siksha Seva Trust (All-India transgender education service trust). 
                  “From January 15 next year, two children who are brought up by the community members will get admission,
                   and from February and March, other classes will start,” Dr Krishna Mohan Mishra, president of the trust.</p>

                   “I am happy that we will be educated and get respect in the society. Education has power,
                    and I am sure it will not only change our lives but also the lives of others,” said Guddi Kinnar,
                     a member of the community.</p>
